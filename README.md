# Stock Price Prediction Project

This repository contains my implementation of a stock price prediction project. The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Overview

- Explored historical stock price data to train and evaluate machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- Implemented different models, including RNN with LSTM and convolutional layers, to compare their performance.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to train, fine-tune, and evaluate the models.
- Assessed model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
- Evaluated the models on both the validation and testing sets to ensure their generalization capability.
- Utilized visualization techniques to compare the predicted stock prices with the actual data.

## Skills Utilized

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning modeling
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Data visualization

## Repository Structure

- data: Contains the historical stock price data in CSV format.
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
- README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Results

- Developed and evaluated machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- Calculated performance metrics such as MSE and RMSE to assess model accuracy.
- Visualized and compared the predicted stock prices with the actual data.

## Future Improvements

- Further optimization and fine-tuning of the models can be explored to improve their performance.
- Advanced feature engineering techniques and additional data sources can be incorporated to enhance the predictive power.
- Ensemble methods or other advanced modeling techniques can be applied to further improve the accuracy.
